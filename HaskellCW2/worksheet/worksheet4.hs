--Sample solutions to Exercise Sheet 4

import Data.List

-- Exercise One
all :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] ->Bool
all p = foldr (&&) True . map p

any :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] ->Bool
any p = foldr (||) False . map p

takeWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
takeWhile p = foldr (consp) []
    where consp x xs = if p x then x : xs else []

-- The next exercise is quite tricky. The solution below uses higher-order functions.
-- The foldr builds up a function! This is a composition of tail functions for as long
-- as the predicate holds. Once the predicate fails, the composition of tail functions
-- is composed with the identity function.
dropWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
dropWhile p xs = (foldr (dropFuns) id xs) xs
   where dropFuns x fs = if p x then fs . tail else id

-- Exercise Two

dec2int = foldl (\n m -> n * 10 + m ) 0

-- Exercise Three

-- Exercise Five
